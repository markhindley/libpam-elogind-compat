Description: Compatibility package for testing integration of libpam-elogind into Debian
 This package allows libpam-elogind to satisfy libpam-systemd dependencies for
 packages which have not yet been updated.
 .
 Please note that libpam-elogind doesn't provide systemd --user. If you require
 that functionality you must install the real libpam-systemd.
 .
 For testing only, this can be removed from Debian once packages have been
 updated to depend on libpam-elogind directly.
