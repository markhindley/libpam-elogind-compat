Description: Compatibility package for testing integration of libpam-elogind into Debian
 This is an empty dependency package which allows libpam-elogind to satisfy
 libpam-systemd dependencies for packages which have not yet been updated.
 .
 Please note that libpam-elogind doesn't provide systemd --user. If you require
 that functionality you must install the real libpam-systemd.
 .
 On Debian systems, this entire package is for testing only.
 It will never be in a Debian release.  It is provided in Debian
 experimental to make testing easier.
